## Example usage

### GitHub secrets

[Github secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#about-encrypted-secrets) assumed to be set:
* `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY` - Personal API key
* `NEW_RELIC_DEPLOYMENT_ENTITY_GUID` - New Relic Entity GUID to create the marker on

>*There are a number of [default GitHub environment variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables) that are used in these examples as well.*
### Minimum required fields

```yaml
name: Change Tracking Marker
on:
  - release
      types: [published]

jobs:
  newrelic:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: New Relic
    steps:
      # This step builds a var with the release tag value to use later
      - name: Set Release Version from Tag
        run: echo "RELEASE_VERSION=${{ github.ref_name }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      # This step creates a new Change Tracking Marker
      - name: New Relic Application Deployment Marker
        uses: newrelic/deployment-marker-action@v2.2.0
        with:
          apiKey: ${{ secrets.NEW_RELIC_API_KEY }}
          guid: ${{ secrets.NEW_RELIC_DEPLOYMENT_ENTITY_GUID }}
          version: "${{ env.RELEASE_VERSION }}"
          user: "${{ github.actor }}"
```

### All input fields

>*In addition to `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY`, this example shows how to target multiple items by storing multiple secrets like "`NEW_RELIC_DEPLOYMENT_ENTITY_GUID_<ID>`", where `<ID>` is the unique identifier for the target item.*

```
NEW_RELIC_DEPLOYMENT_ENTITY_GUID_App123
NEW_RELIC_DEPLOYMENT_ENTITY_GUID_App456
NEW_RELIC_DEPLOYMENT_ENTITY_GUID_App789
